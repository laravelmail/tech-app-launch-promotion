From the very beginning, the platform has been incredibly user-friendly and intuitive, making it easy for a beginner like me to get started. Setting up my podcast was a breeze. The step-by-step guidance helped me create my RSS feed, submit my show to major directories like Apple Podcasts and Spotify, and even design a professional-looking podcast website. The analytics dashboard is also super helpful, giving me clear insights into my audience and episode performance. What really stands out about RSS.com is their customer support. Whenever I had a question, their team was quick to respond and incredibly helpful. Plus, the pricing is transparent and affordable, especially for the value you get. If you’re looking for a reliable, easy-to-use podcast hosting platform that grows with you, I highly recommend RSS.com.
